# make-scenarios

Collection of Make (Integromat) scenario blueprints used to demonstrate automation skills.

## Scenarios

- [1-Create Google Calendar events from data on your Google Sheet](./docs/1-create-google-calendar-events.md)  
  Create calendar events from rows in a Google Sheet; supports multiple attendees parsed from a sheet column.
  
  A short visual walkthrough (with screenshots) is included in the scenario doc to help you get started quickly.

## Contributing

- Add new scenario JSON files at the repo root or in a named folder.
- Add a scenario-specific README under docs/ with the same base name and link it from this main README.
- Sanitize any sensitive data (API keys, account IDs, emails) before committing.

## Notes

This repo keeps blueprints sanitized. Replace placeholders in the blueprint JSON with your own connection IDs and spreadsheet IDs when importing into Make.
